## Introduce 

This is my final work of  Compiler theory course

It is a Simple C compiler.

When this program run, it will translate a C program to  Assembly language program!

you can run this Assembly language program in suitable environment and get the same result as the original C Program!

## Input  && Output 

 -  `INPUT`
     
     it will get the input data (a c program ) from `/complier5/Data/input.txt` each run.

 -  `OUTPUT`
    
     it will output the result (a Assembly language program ) in  `/complier5/Data/output.asm` each run.

     Also it also print the Address assignment status in `/complier5/Data/print.txt`, so you can see the detail if you needed.
